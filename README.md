## How to Screenshot on Mac


There are several key combinations that you can use to take screenshots on Mac, with shift + command + 3 being the most commonly used. This key combination immediately snaps a screenshot of your entire screen, including all visible windows, the desktop, the dock, and any other visible elements.


1. Open the window you want to screenshot, or otherwise arrange the screen to your liking.
2. Press and hold shift + command + 3.

3. You will hear a snapshot sound, and a small image of your screenshot will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.

4. If you click the thumbnail in the bottom right corner of the screen, you can open a preview of the screenshot.




## How to Screenshot Part of the Screen on Mac


If you want to screenshot a single window, then you can use a variation on the previous key combination. This option changes your cursor into a camera icon and lets you snap a shot of any active window.



1. Open the window you need a screenshot of, then press and hold shift + command + 4 + spacebar.

2. Your cursor will turn into a camera.

3. Move the camera icon over the window you want to capture, and click.

4. Your Mac will take a screenshot of the window you clicked, and a preview will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.



## How to Use the Screenshot App on Mac



Your Mac also has a screenshot app that provides some more advanced option as long as you have upgraded the operating system to Mojave (10.14) or newer. This compact app gives you action to the same basic capture options you can achieve with key combinations, but it also allows you to delay your screenshot and provides some other options.


1. Press and hold shift + command + 5 to open the screenshot app.

2. To screenshot the entire screen, click the left screenshot icon that looks like a box with a line at the bottom, then click anywhere on the screen.

3. To screenshot a window, click the middle screenshot icon that looks like a window, then click the window you want to capture

4. To capture a specific area of your screen, click the right screenshot icon, click and drag the highlighted area, then click capture to screenshot the specified area.

5. You can also click Options to access a variety of settings.

6. Within the options menu you can:

	* Choose the location where your screenshots are saved.
	* Set a delay timer for your screenshots.
	* Choose a microphone for video recordings.
	* Set advanced options.
